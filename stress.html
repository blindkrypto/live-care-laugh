            <p>Stress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it’s real or imagined—the
                 body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the “stress 
                 response.”
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Stress</h2>
            <p> Stress management can be complicated and confusing because there are different types of stress — acute stress, episodic acute
                 stress, and chronic stress — each with its own characteristics, symptoms, duration and treatment approaches.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><b>Acute stress</b> - It is the most common type of stress, and is not always negative.
                    An acute stress reaction occurs when symptoms develop due to a particularly stressful event. The word 'acute' means the 
                    symptoms develop quickly but do not usually last long. The events are usually very severe and an acute stress reaction
                     typically occurs after an unexpected life crisis. This might be, for example, a serious accident, sudden bereavement, or
                      other traumatic events. Road traffic accidents cause many casualties each year and you may be directly or indirectly 
                      affected by this kind of exceptionally stressful event. Acute stress reactions may also occur as a consequence of sexual
                       assaults or domestic violence.
                    Acute stress isn't always negative. It's also the experience you have when riding a rollercoaster or having a person jump 
                    out at you in a haunted house. Isolated episodes of acute stress should not have any lingering health effects. In fact, they
                    ight actually be healthy for you, as these stressful situations give your body and brain practice in developing the best 
                    response to future stressful situations.
                </li>
                <li><b>Episodic Stress</b>-It may be hard for people with this type of stress to change their lifestyle, as they accept stress
                     as a part of life.When acute stress happens frequently, it’s called episodic acute stress. People who always seem to be
                      having a crisis tend to have episodic acute stress. They are often short-tempered, irritable, and anxious. People who are
                     “worry warts” or pessimistic or who tend to see the negative side of everything also tend to have episodic acute stress.
                     Negative health effects are persistent in people with episodic acute stress. It may be hard for people with this type of 
                     stress to change their lifestyle, as they accept stress as a part of life.
                </li>
                <li><b>Chronic stress</b>-if acute stress isn't resolved and begins to increase or lasts for long periods of time, it becomes 
                    chronic stress.
                    This stress is constant and doesn’t go away. It can stem from such things as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            poverty
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            dysfunctional family
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            dysfunctional family
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a bad job
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Chronic stress can be detrimental to your health, as it can contribute to several serious diseases or health risks, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            heart disease
                        </li>        
                        <li>
                            cancer
                        </li>        
                        <li>
                            lung disease
                        </li>        
                        <li>
                            accidents
                        </li>        
                        <li>
                            cirrhosis of the liver
                        </li>        
                        <li>
                            suicide
                        </li>        
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes of Stress</h2>
            <p>There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to why we get stressed. Each of us reacts differently to situations, and the causes of stress range from external factors like family, career, etc. to our attitude towards life such as negativity and pessimism.
                The situations and pressures that cause stress are known as stressors. We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as an exhausting work schedule or a rocky relationship. However, anything that puts high demands on you can be stressful. This includes positive events such as getting married, buying a house, going to college, or receiving a promotion.
                Of course, not all stress is caused by external factors. Stress can also be internal or self-generated, when you worry excessively about something that may or may not happen, or have irrational, pessimistic thoughts about life.
                Finally, what causes stress depends, at least in part, on your perception of it. Something that’s stressful to you may not faze someone else; they may even enjoy it. While some of us are terrified of getting up in front of people to perform or speak, for example, others live for the spotlight. Where one person thrives under pressure and performs best in the face of a tight deadline, another will shut down when work demands escalate.

            <h2>Signs and symptoms of stress</h2>
            <p>The most dangerous thing about stress is how easily it can creep up on you. You get used to it. It starts to feel familiar, even normal. You don’t notice how much it’s affecting you, even as it takes a heavy toll. That’s why it’s important to be aware of the common warning signs and symptoms of stress overload.

                <h2>Managing Stress</h2>
                <p>Stress affects each person differently. Some people may get headaches or stomachaches, while others may lose sleep or get depressed or angry. People under constant stress may also get sick a lot. Managing stress is important to staying healthy.
                    It’s impossible to completely get rid of stress. The goal of stress management is to identify your stressors, which are the things that cause you the most problems or demand the most of your energy. In doing so, you can overcome the negative stress those things induce.
                    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,recommend the following to help cope with stress:
                    take care of yourself, by eating healthy, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep
                    find support by talking to other people to get your problems off your chest
                    connect socially, as it’s easy to isolate yourself after a stressful event
                    take a break from whatever is causing you stress
                    avoid drugs and alcohol, which may seem to help with stress in the short term, but can actually cause more problems in the long term.
